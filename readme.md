# Hide'n'seek: studying ai and js game development

This is my playground for testing purposes.
It uses docker to be platform independent.
It also makes use of a couple well known open source libraries for game development.


# DOCKER
The docker branch is now working as expected. So it's just one easy command to run.

Please make sure to use the [docker branch](https://github.com/mychiara/my-hide-n-seek-playground/tree/docker).

## Requirements

Install docker.
- For [Mac](https://www.docker.com/products/docker#/mac)
- For [Windows](https://www.docker.com/products/docker#/windows)

```shell

cd /local-path/to/repo

docker-compose up -d

```

That's it :]
